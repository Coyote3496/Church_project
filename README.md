A website questionnaire for a local church.
Collect information from the survey taker to later group the data, ask all 128 pre-uploaded questions, display results on a thank you page, and send results in an email. 
Meant to help collect data and simplify the collection of data, taking things from paper to online.

Future updates:
Add data sorting system
